# Modifiable Rock, Paper, Scissors
Editing guide: [link](editing.md)

This repository contains the code for the popular game "Rock, paper, Scissors" written in Python.
All source code is inside the folder `src`, available for everyone.

# Playing in browser
You do not have to download the game in order to play it. It is available in the browser thanks to repl.it.<br>
The game is available at https://replit.com/@RGameZ/ModifiableRPS. To play, go to the script `main.py` and click "Run".

# Downloading (release)
The guides for downloading the game are in the releases section. Each page has its own guide.<br>
The latest version is `v1.0.0` and it is available [here](https://github.com/R1DF/Modifiable-RPS/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

# Downloading (via source code)
This option is much more preferable if you wish to change the game's code.
1. Download Python 3.9 or later. from [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)*.
2. **If you don't have the TOML library,** install the module.
    - `pip install toml`
    - Take a look at [this link](https://pypi.org/project/toml/) for more info
3. Download all 4 files in the `src` directory, which include:
    - `main.py` 
    - `game.py`
    - `items.toml`
    - `messages.toml`
4. In the same directory of your choice, copy/move these files.<br><br>

The game runs much better in the **terminal**. If you want to play, go to the command line and the game's directory and enter `py main.py` to run.<br>
